``antaresFlowbased`` allows to model **flow-based** domains into adequacy studies using the software *Antares*, with the following main functionalities: 

**1. Preparation of the input of an Antares study to include a modelling a flow-based in the CWE area**

- Projection of flow-based domains on a fix basis  so as to be able to describe them in Antares with binding constraints.
- Construction of probabilistic flow-based time series respecting the correlations with other inputs of the study (e.g. load, wind power generation, solar generation).
- Automatic filling of the inputs of the Antares study 

**2. Post-processing and visualisation of Antaresâ€™ results**

- Application of the adequacy patch to re-balance the exchanges in the CWE area in case of generation shortages
- Visualisation of the net-positions of the countries of the CWE area along with the limits imposed by the flow-based domains


This vignette describe the first set of functionnalities : the preparation of the inputs for the Antares study.

## 1 - Summary

```{r, eval=FALSE}

#Convert domains from PTDF file, save the output in the directory "model1"
computeFB(PTDF = system.file("/input/ptdf/PTDF.csv", package = "antaresFlowbased"),
          outputName = "D:/model1", verbose = 0, nbFaces = 36)


#Set antares study path
antaresRead::setSimulationPath("D:/exemple_test", 0)

#Create flow-based time series considering their correlations with other inputs of an Antares Study, save the output in the directory "model1"
createFBTS(probabilityMatrix = probabilityMatrix, multiplier = multiplier,
           interSeasonBegin = interSeasonBegin,
           interSeasonEnd = interSeasonEnd, firstDay = firstDay, outputPath = "D:/model1")


#Set setFlowbased directory path
setFlowbasedPath(path = "D:/model1")

#Run shiny application to visualize the results of the convertion
runAppError()

#Initialize the Antares study
initFlowBased()

```

## 2 - Projection of domains

The function ``computeFB()`` converts flow-based domains (e.g. historical flow-based domains of some "typical representative days") into an Antares model with fixed PTDF. It uses the main following parameters : 

* ``PTDF`` : PTDF file path
* ``outputName`` : name of output directory
* ``reports`` : Boolean indicating whether the function generates html reports or not

``PTDF`` is a csv file with **;** field separator, **,** for decimal points and the following columns :

* ``Id_day`` : Id of typical day (integer)
* ``Period`` : Hour (integer from 1 to 24), period i corresponds to the hourly time-step [i-1 ; i]
* ``BE`` : PTDF for be 
* ``DE`` : PTDF for de
* ``FR`` : PTDF for fr
* ``NL`` : PTDF for nl
* ``RAM`` : margin

A PTDF file at this format can be automatically generated by using the function ``writePtdfOfTypicalDays`` of the package ``flowBasedClustering``.
One can also set the following optionnal arguments of the function :

* ``dayType`` : subset of typical days to process
* ``hour`` : subset of hours to process
* ``nbFaces`` : number of binding constraints in the final Antares model (by default : 36).

The function creates a directory with the following files :

* ``weight.txt`` : PTDF for the antares model (weight of the binding constraints - constant over time)
* ``second_member.txt`` : RAM for the antares model (second member of the binding constraints - variable over the typical days and hours)
* ``domainesFB.RDS`` : Information about the modeled domains (points, errors , accuracy of the model,...)
* ``reports`` : a directory, created only if ``reports == TRUE`` with a html report for each typical day.


## 3 - Creation of flow-based time series

The previous function - ``computeFB()`` - converts the typical flow-based days in a format suited for Antares. 

The next step consists in defining, for each day of each Monte-Carlo year, which typical flow-based day will be used to bound the exchanges within the CWE area. The function ``createFBTS()`` performs this task. Possible correlations between the flow-based shapes and external variables (e.g. load, wind power generation, solar generation) can be taken into account. Therefore, the function ``createFBTS()`` considers other inputs of the Antares study and the way they influence the occurences of the typical days.

The main inputs of this function are : 

* ``probabilityMatrix`` : the probability matrix carry the information on the correlations between the typical days and external variables. They are calculated with the function ``getProbability()`` of the package ``flowBasedClustering``. The names of the columns of the probability matrix must correspond to inputs of the Antares study by respecting the following syntax ``area@variable`` (e.g. : ``fr@load``, ``de@solar``, ``be@wind``). If needed, the columns can be easily renamed with the function ``setNamesProbabilityMatrix()``.

* ``multiplier`` : The probability matrix levels are usually computed on normalized data (e.g. load factor for RES generation). They can be rescale to the time series of the Antares study by using a multiplier.

* ``interSeasonBegin``, ``interSeasonEnd`` and ``firstDay`` : defines the calendar, i.e. the the boundaries between the different seasons (winter, summer, interseason) and the week-end days. the ``firstDay`` can be automatically identified with the function ``identifyFirstDays()`` which will look for patterns in the load time series to identify which days are saturdays and sundays.


* ``opts`` : a link toward an antares study, as returned by the function ``setSimulationPath()`` from the package ``antaresRead``.


* ``outputPath`` : directory where the file `ts.txt`, containing the time series of typical flow-based days, will be written.


An example of the use of ``createFBTS()`` is given below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# build probabilityMatrix with the function getProbability() from the package flowBasedClustering
# select an antaresStudy with the function setSimulationPath() from the package antaresRead

# rename columns of the probability matrix

matProb <- setNamesProbabilityMatrix(probabilityMatrix, c("FR_load", "DE_wind", "DE_solar"),
                                   c("fr@load", "de@wind", "de@solar"))

# set multipliers

multiplier <- data.frame(variable = c("fr@load", "de@wind", "de@solar"),
                         coef = c(1, 35000, 40000))
       
# set Calendar
firstDay <- identifyFirstDay(opts = antaresStudy)
interSeasonBegin <- as.Date(c("2017-09-03", "2018-02-02"))
interSeasonEnd <- as.Date(c("2020-10-04", "2018-05-02"))

# create ts.txt in D:/model1
ts <- createFBTS(opts = antaresStudy, probabilityMatrix = probabilityMatrix, multiplier = multiplier,
                 interSeasonBegin = interSeasonBegin,
                 interSeasonEnd = interSeasonEnd, firstDay = firstDay, outputPath = "D:/model1")


```


## 4 - Set the flow-based model

Once the modeled flow-based domains have been created with ``computeFB()`` and ``createFBTS()``, they can be loaded using the following function :

* ``setFlowbasedPath()`` : set the model directory (directory in which the output of ``computeFB()`` have been saved)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Specify a repository
setFlowbasedPath(path = "C:/PATH/TO/INPUT")
```


The directory must contain :

* ``weight.txt`` : PTDF for the antares model (weight of the binding constraints - constant over time)
* ``second_member.txt`` : RAM for the antares model (second member of the binding constraints - variable over the typical days and hours)
* ``domainesFB.RDS`` : Information about domains (points, errors ,...)
* ``ts.txt`` : flow-based time series


## 5 - Visualization & reports

One can visualize the modeled flow-based domains, download the associated data or create a summary of the model accuracy in a html document using a **shiny** application with the function ``runAppError()``.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
runAppError()
```

<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">
<img src="shiny.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 90%; height: 90%">
</div>


``plotFB()`` can also be used to plot one or more domains directly in R : 

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
library(antaresFlowbased)
setFlowbasedPath(model = "model2017")
```

```{r, fig.width= 7, fig.height= 7, warning=FALSE}

# multiple countries and hour
plotFB(hour = 5:6, dayType = 1, country1 = c("FR", "DE"), country2 = c("DE", "NL"))

```

Reports in html format can also be generated within the shiny application. This solution can be use to facilitate the transmission and communication of the results.
<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">
<img src="report.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 90%; height: 90%">
</div>


## 6 - Study initialization

This last step allows to prepare the inputs of an Antares study so as to include flow-based domains to bound CWE exchanges.

It is first necessary to select an antares study using ``setSimulationPath()`` function of the package ``antaresRead``, and the flow-based model which will be set on this study must be specified with ``setFlowbasedPath()``. 

The initialization of the study is then done with the function ``initFlowBased()``. This function creates the inputs of the Antares study related to the flow-based modelling, with the appropriate binding constraints and virtual thermal plants.

The time-series of flow-based domains used for each Monte-Carlo years are desribed with the parameter ``scenarios``. For instance, with ``scenario = rep(1:200, times = 5)`` (default value), up to 1000 Monte-Carlo years can be simulated with 5 blocks of, successively, time series 1 to 200. This "scenario building mode" is written in the file ``user/flowbased/scenario.txt`` of the Antares Study.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
antaresRead::setSimulationPath("D:/exemple_test", 0)

# initialisation of flow-based study
initFlowBased(scenario = rep(1:200, times = 5))
```


## 6 - Run simulations

Once all these steps have been performed, the Antares study can be run as usual, for instance using the `run simulation` button of the software interface.
